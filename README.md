## üí° About This Project

This project brings to life a database systems assignment from my Master's program at the University of the People. The original assignment involved designing a robust database for a fictional beauty retailer, "FairyGlow Beauty." I decided to expand on this by creating a functional front-end prototype to visualize how the business would interact with that data.

My goal was to build a clean, modern, and data-driven dashboard using only **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project demonstrates my ability to handle application state, manipulate the DOM, and create interactive data visualizations without relying on any external frameworks. It's a practical showcase of building a feature-rich application from the ground up.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This prototype simulates an internal business dashboard for FairyGlow Beauty, with a multi-page layout and advanced features:

* **üìà Main Dashboard:** A central hub with KPI cards for at-a-glance metrics like Total Revenue, Sales, New Customers, and Average Rating.
* **üìä Interactive Charts:** Uses Chart.js to create dynamic bar and doughnut charts for visualizing sales trends and product category distribution.
* **üóÇÔ∏è Multiple Data Views:** Navigate between dedicated pages for **Products**, **Orders**, and **Customers**, each displaying relevant data in clean, sortable tables.
* **üì¢ Marketing Dashboard:** A specialized view to track campaign performance, customer segments, and return on ad spend (ROAS).
* **Advanced Analytics:** The dashboard includes modern e-commerce metrics like **Sales Velocity** for products and **Customer Segmentation** (VIP, New, At-Risk).
* **Responsive Design:** A fully responsive interface that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** A theme toggle for user preference and accessibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
-   **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first approach to styling and creating a responsive design.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, including:
    -   Modular code architecture (`App`, `UI`, `Data` objects)
    -   State management
    -   DOM manipulation and component-based rendering
    -   Event handling
-   **Chart.js:** For creating beautiful and interactive data visualizations.
-   **Lucide Icons:** For clean and modern iconography.
